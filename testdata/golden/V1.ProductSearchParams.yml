      The resource name of a [ProductSet][google.cloud.vision.v1.ProductSet] to be searched for similar images.

      Format is:

  - name: product_categories
    description: |-
      The list of product categories to search in. Currently, we only consider
      the first category, and either "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2", "toys-v2",
      "packagedgoods-v1", or "general-v1" should be specified. The legacy
      categories "homegoods", "apparel", and "toys" are still supported but will
      be deprecated. For new products, please use "homegoods-v2", "apparel-v2",
      or "toys-v2" for better product search accuracy. It is recommended to
      migrate existing products to these categories as well.

      Generated from protobuf field <code>repeated string product_categories = 7;</code>
  - name: filter
    description: |-
      The filtering expression. This can be used to restrict search results based
      on Product labels. We currently support an AND of OR of key-value
      expressions, where each expression within an OR must have the same key. An
      '=' should be used to connect the key and value.

      For example, "(color = red OR color = blue) AND brand = Google" is
      acceptable, but "(color = red OR brand = Google)" is not acceptable.
      "color: red" is not acceptable because it uses a ':' instead of an '='.
